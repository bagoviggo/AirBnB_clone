### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building the first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called ```BaseModel```) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (```User```, ```State```, ```City```, ```Place```…) that inherit from ```BaseModel```
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## More info
The shell should look like this in interactive mode.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode:``` $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash```
